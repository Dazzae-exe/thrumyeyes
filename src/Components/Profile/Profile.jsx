        Im an amateur photographer born and raised in venezuela. Growing up
        I&apos;ve always had a hunger and eye for photography and every kind of
        art. My surroundings has influenced my unique, vintage and old school
        but clean style within my photographs. No matter where I am, Im always
        thinking about what I can capture with my camera. I couldn&apos;t
        imagine life where I was not creating freely and putting my heart into
        my art.
      </p>
      <p className="Profile-Text">
        Through my images I like to capture emotions and feelings that I&apos;m
        going through at the moment or the subject I&apos;m photographing. I
        love working with and meeting new people, and throughout this journey I
        have done just that. I want to show the world what I see through my eyes
        and in this case, through my lens.
      </p>
      <p className="Profile-Text">
        I&apos;d say this is like saving memories in a picture. I want to draw
        emotion from people when they look at my photographs whether its bad or
        good I just want you to feel something when you see each of my pictures.
        I&apos;m pretty sure they all gonna make you feel something different.
